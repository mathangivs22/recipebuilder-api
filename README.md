# 🍽️ Recipe Builder App

Recipe Builder is a full-stack web application that helps users discover recipes easily through both a **search-based UI** and an **interactive chatbot experience**.

The app allows users to explore recipes, filter them based on ingredients, and view complete cooking instructions in a simple and user-friendly interface.
